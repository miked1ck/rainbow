# Vinscent's 🍷

A React infinite scrolling category wheel. Elastic / perfect for web apps: adapts to the size of any viewport. Extend the data file to be anything: recipes, lists, flash cards, etc.

In this example, we created a wine aroma wheel, for assisting wine enthusiasts in identifying scent characteristics of wine by category.

## Install

First clone or download the app to your local machine, and install all dependencies with:

```
npm install

```

Then boot the express server that is included by running:

```
npm start

```

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

To develop, you'll need to make sure that webpack is watching for changes when you save, so that it can auto bundle everything together. To set up a webpack watcher to bundle upon each save:

```
npm run dev

```

In order to bundle one time, and NOT run a watch:

```
npm run build

```

Hope you Enjoy!
